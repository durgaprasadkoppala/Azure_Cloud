# Microsoft Azure ETL Project

In this project, I leveraged Microsoft Azure to streamline data ingestion, transformation, and validation using ETL processes and working with real transaction data from PayPal.

🔹 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 from Blob Storage and integrated it into Azure Data Factory.

🔹 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱 and 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 by feeding multiple PayPal data sources into a single dataset, applying filters based on transaction status.

🔹 Utilized 𝗘𝗧𝗟 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 to clean and prepare data, ensuring it's optimized and ready for analysis before integrating it into the system.

🔹 Used 𝗦𝗶𝗻𝗸 to transfer transformed data into a database and ensured 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 for any flow interruptions, making it easy to identify and resolve issues promptly.

🔹 Created an automated 𝗽𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 with a trigger to activate the data flow, enabling seamless ETL transformation and preprocessing.
